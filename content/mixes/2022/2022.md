**Snoopy's Christmas - The Royal Guardsmen**
1967 follow-up to "Snoopy vs. the Red Baron" depicting a fictional Christmas Eve dogfight ending with Snoopy and the Red Baron sharing a holiday toast behind enemy lines. Hit #1 in New Zealand and Australia.

**Ringing Bells (Sweet Music), Pt. 2 - Young Senators**
DC Go-Go pioneers' psychedelic soul track reissued in 2016 after 45 years. Not actually a Christmas song despite the "ringing bells" title—DC septet backed Eddie Kendricks in 1972 before fading into obscurity.

**Christmas Day - Squeeze**
1979 melancholic look at Christmas through the lens of post-holiday cleanup from British new wave masters known for clever, observational songwriting about everyday life.

**Stop The Cavalry - Jona Lewie**
1980 anti-war song that wasn't meant to be a Christmas song—only mentions Christmas in one line. Record company added tubular bells to make it sound festive. Peaked at #3 UK and became a perennial holiday favorite.

**O Little Town Of Bethlehem - Sister Rosetta Tharpe**
1956 gospel recording from the "Godmother of rock and roll"—widely acclaimed as one of the greatest Sanctified gospel singers, known for flamboyant performances blending gospel, blues and swing.

**The Bells of St. Mary's - The Drifters**

**Merry Christmas Baby - Vernon Garrett**
"I Didn't Get Nothin' for Christmas" from Ichiban Blues At Christmas compilation—Southern-fried funk from Atlanta's modern blues label, described by the Washington Post as "the last authentic Southern blues."

**I Want To Come Home For Christmas - Marvin Gaye**
Recorded 1972 about a Vietnam POW, Motown rejected it for being too political. Released posthumously 18 years later. One of the most poignant anti-war Christmas songs ever recorded.

**Player's Ball - OutKast**
1993 debut single—OutKast is the only hip-hop act to debut with a Christmas song. Refers to an annual Atlanta party thrown during Christmas. Released 10 days early on LaFace Family Christmas compilation.

**Llegó Navidad - Los Lobos**
Title track from the Grammy-winning East LA Chicano band's first holiday album in 2019. They researched nearly 150 Christmas songs from across North, Central and South America before recording.

**Auld Lang Syne - Jimi Hendrix**
Band of Gypsys New Year's Eve performance at Fillmore East, December 31, 1969 at midnight. Historic recording marking the turn of the decade.

**Le petit renne au nez rouge - Danièle & Michèle**

San Jose plasterer who performed around the Bay Area made this barely-known 1983 private-issue funky soul Christmas album. Reissued by Numero Group. Washington passed away in late 2021.

**The Loneliest Christmas Tree - Lisa Miller**
Lisa Miller recorded this when she was 10 or 11 years old in 1967. Her voice sounds way older than that. The song was written by her mother and aunt. B-side to "Love Is" on Canterbury label.

**Santa Claus Ain't A Hippie - Charlie Stewart**
Obscure recording with limited information available. You tell me.

**White Christmas - Jo Stafford**

**Just a Sad Xmas - The Soul Duo**
1969/70 Shiptown label recording described as "almost an anti-Christmas song." Melancholic holiday blues.
