Merry Christmas friends and family far and wide. I'm not sure what 2024 will bring, but am glad to be surrounded by those I love. (And good music). My encouragement to you is pay attention to the people who surround you and less to all the noise: all the things you can't control (which is most things).

Will have the audio files up soon, enjoy the Spotify playlist in the meantime.
