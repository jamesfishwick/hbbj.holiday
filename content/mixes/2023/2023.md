Merry Christmas, friends and family. Happy Birthday Baby Jesus.

It's been a long year, and we're happy to be done with it. How you doing?

Sure, it can be a magical time filled with joy, warmth, and festivity. It's a period where twinkling lights decorate the streets, the air is filled with the aroma of seasonal treats, and the sound of cheerful music like this is everywhere. Families and friends may come together, trying to share in the spirit of giving and gratitude, creating memories that last a lifetime (for better or worse).

With a flurry of activities like shopping for gifts, planning family gatherings, and mixing dope Xmas mixes, it's easy to get caught up in the hoopla, clap-trap, commercialism and all the rest of it that I don't even need to go into. These distractions can sometimes overshadow the tranquility and reflective aspects of the season. Hope you find a quiet moment to rest and fix your attention on something still and beautiful.

Just a reminder that the official feast of Christmas isn't over until the celebration of the Baptism of the Lord which this year is celebrated on Sunday, January 7. So rock the bells until then!
