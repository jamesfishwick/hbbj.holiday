Merry Christmas, friends and family. Happy Birthday Baby Jesus.

It's been a long year, and we're happy to be done with it. How you doing?

## The 2023 Holiday Mix Philosophy

Sure, it can be a magical time filled with joy, warmth, and festivity. Twinkling lights decorate the streets, the air is filled with the aroma of seasonal treats, and the sound of cheerful music (like this) is everywhere. Families and friends may come together, trying to share in the spirit of giving and gratitude, creating memories that last a lifetime (for better or worse).

With a flurry of activities like shopping for gifts, planning family gatherings, and mixing dope Xmas mixes, it's easy to get caught up in the hoopla, clap-trap, commercialism and all the rest of it that I don't even need to go into. These distractions can sometimes overshadow the tranquility and reflective aspects of the season. Hope you find a quiet moment to rest and fix your attention on something still and beautiful.

## Track-by-Track

**Jarvis Fishwick - Jingle Bells on Trombone**

**Bruce Haack - I Like Christmas**
Pioneering electronic music composer Bruce Haack made this for his 1976 album "Ebenezer Electric"—all robotic voices and synthesized Christmas cheer decades before anyone else was doing it.

**The Three Suns - Ding Dong Dandy Christmas**
1959 space-age lounge album with accordion, guitar, tuba, organ, two tubas, chimes, bells and an oboe. The Three Suns used their RCA Victor sessions as an audio laboratory playing with stereo separation.

**James Brown - Soulful Christmas (DJ Catalist Remix)**
DJ Catalist's remix of James Brown's funky Christmas classic.

**The Soul Saints Orchestra - Santa's Got A Bag Of Soul**
German deep funk revival kings made this in 1994 as a Christmas giveaway—only 250 copies. Jazzman re-released it in 2005. Still one of the rarest funk Christmas tracks.

**Too Many Zooz - Funky Christmas feat. Big Freedia**
Brass house trio (baritone sax, trumpet, drums) teamed up with New Orleans Queen of Bounce Big Freedia for their first collaboration in 2020. Avant-garde jazz meets EDM meets bounce.

**Book Of Love - We Three Kings (2016 Remaster)**
1987 synth-pop Christmas cover that appeared on Warner Bros.' "Yulesville" compilation alongside Erasure, The Pretenders, Prince, and The Ramones. Described as "weird, and thoroughly enjoyable."

**The Go Go's - I'm Gonna Spend My Christmas With A Dalek**
1964 UK novelty single from Newcastle rock band (not the 80s girl group). Released during "Dalekmania" between Beatlemania and the counterculture. This was their only recorded song. Only 500 pressed.

**Jørgen Ingmann - The Christmas Song**
Instrumental guitar version from Denmark's first Eurovision winner. Swinging Christmas vibes from the early 60s.

**Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons - Jungle Bells**
Full title: "Jungle Bells (Dingo-Dongo-Day)." Cowritten by lounge legend Sid Bass. Circus animals celebrating Christmas in the jungle. Dreadfully silly.

**The Free Design - Close Your Mouth (It's Christmas)**
1968 psychedelic sunshine pop from four siblings. Pure baroque pop weirdness.

**Grandaddy - It was a Silent Night at least until Jeff Lynne arrived**
Jason Lytle rewrote "Silent Night" to be about ELO producer Jeff Lynne showing up at someone's house as Santa. "My little light hearted holiday combo-homage" from 2021.

**Bob Seger and The Last Heard - Sock It To Me Santa**
1966 Detroit garage rock Christmas burner. "Like Mitch Ryder on trucker's speed."

**The Chambers Brothers - Merry Christmas, Happy New Year**
Psychedelic soul Christmas single on Columbia Records.

**Arthur Prysock - A Working Man's Prayer**
1966 jazz ballad about a struggling farmer at Christmas. Arthur Prysock's deep velvety voice telling a story about hardship and hope.

**Esquivel And His Orchestra - Blue Christmas**
Space-age bachelor pad master Esquivel giving Elvis's classic the stereo separation, strange instrumentation, and nonsense syllable treatment on his 1959/1996 Christmas album.

**Arthur Lyman - Christmas Song**
The only exotica artist from the 50s-60s to record a Christmas album. Vibraphone and marimba with Hawaiian instruments and sound effects—shrieking macaws, rolling surf.

**Captain Elmo Mckenzie & The Roosters - Home On Christmas Day**
2009 nu-disco Christmas track from Strut Records. Not reggae like you'd expect from the name.

**Bellamy Bros - Old Hippie Christmas**
2002 country comedy about Christmas at the commune with tie-dye, love beads, Gene Autry's Rudolph, and the Grateful Dead doing Silent Night.

**Blur - The Wassailing Song**
Britpop legends recorded "The Gloucestershire Wassail" in 1992 during a break from making "Modern Life Is Rubbish." Released 500 copies as "Gold, Frankincense and Blur" and gave them away after a gig by a guy dressed as Santa. Only Blur song where drummer Dave Rowntree sings. Their music teacher taught it to Damon Albarn and Graham Coxon in school in the early 80s.

**J Roddy Walston - Is It Christmas Tonight?**
Southern rocker's Christmas original, regularly featured in his annual "Xmas to the Bone" tours.

**Hep Stars - Christmas On My Mind**
Swedish 60s rock with "especially cool Hammond organ work from Benny"—Benny Andersson, before ABBA. First ABBA-related Christmas album. First Hep Stars single that didn't chart.

**J. Reed - Christmas Present Blues**
Blues Christmas track.

**Orchids - Christmas is the Time to Be with Your Baby**
1964 doo-wop from New York girl group on Columbia Records. Rare—not many sixties girl group Christmas songs outside The Supremes and Phil Spector.

**Three Aces and a Joker - Sleigh Bell Rock**
Only 600 copies pressed in 1960 on a Salt Lake City label. "Maybe the greatest rockabilly Christmas song ever." Extremely rare—only a couple copies shown up on auction sites in the last decade.

**Ira Ironstrings - Christmas Is for the Birds**
Ira Ironstrings was the pseudonym of big band guitarist Alvino Rey, known for his "talking" steel guitar. This 1959 novelty album is "one of the greatest instrumental Christmas albums of all time"—marketed as "Christmas Music for Those Who Have Heard Everything."

## Extended Christmas Season

Just a reminder that the official feast of Christmas isn't over until the celebration of the Baptism of the Lord which this year is celebrated on Sunday, January 7. So rock the bells until then!
