Merry Christmas, friends and family. Happy Birthday Baby Jesus.

It's been a long year, and we're happy to be done with it. How you doing?

## The 2023 Holiday Mix Philosophy

Sure, it can be a magical time filled with joy, warmth, and festivity. It's a period where twinkling lights decorate the streets, the air is filled with the aroma of seasonal treats, and the sound of cheerful music like this is everywhere. Families and friends may come together, trying to share in the spirit of giving and gratitude, creating memories that last a lifetime (for better or worse).

With a flurry of activities like shopping for gifts, planning family gatherings, and mixing dope Xmas mixes, it's easy to get caught up in the hoopla, clap-trap, commercialism and all the rest of it that I don't even need to go into. These distractions can sometimes overshadow the tranquility and reflective aspects of the season. Hope you find a quiet moment to rest and fix your attention on something still and beautiful.

## Featured in This Year's Christmas Playlist

This 2023 mix balances festive celebration with moments of peaceful reflection. You'll find:

- **Traditional Christmas Carols**: Time-honored songs that anchor the holiday spirit
- **Modern Holiday Tracks**: Fresh takes on Christmas music for 2023
- **Contemplative Seasonal Music**: Perfect for quiet winter evenings
- **Upbeat Festive Numbers**: Great for holiday parties and gatherings

## Extended Christmas Season

Just a reminder that the official feast of Christmas isn't over until the celebration of the Baptism of the Lord which this year is celebrated on Sunday, January 7. So rock the bells until then!
